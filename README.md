## Project Brief
The company wishes to analyse sales to determine the most popular menu items and also those which produce the most revenue. 
They also wish to find out the most popular product groups and those which provide the most revenue. 
Finally, they wish to construct a “league table” of the total weekly and monthly sales of the various outlets so that their sales performance can be monitored easily.
